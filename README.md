## Addons

This section is mostly a list of all of our addons in the website, currently.

### Dark/Scratch Themes

This addon lets you fairly select your most favorite theme, either Dark, Light, or Scratch. Your choice ;)

### Swatches

This will essentially add pre-selected colors to your color picker, so it is fairly more easier to color your art & costumes!
There's also an experimental mode, if no colors currently match your needs.

### Larger page scaling

This addon was made so you generally don't have to zoom in on the page in order to see the icons, which is essentially quite significant.

### Bigger icons

This one will just make the icons selector a bit larger, for those who can't see clearly.

This addon was made for users to select more fonts in their costumes, if no current font matches their needs.
